## Notes & shoutouts

I made tons of research from youtube, google, and I was struggling with how to set up the serializer and route. There are always some unknown problems that make me go crazy, it was a challenging project since I have never done it before. Eventually, I've finished this project after I spend lots of my hours and made tons of research, and I find out it was actually pretty easy, I have to get more familiar with Ember.
